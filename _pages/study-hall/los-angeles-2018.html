      <p><span></span><strong>About THE LIBRARY™</strong><span><strong>:</strong> The Library is a sustainable literacy fashion label running an education initiative: Study Hall in collaboration with MIT Media Lab. Its mission is to foster meaningful collaborations within the Fashion industry to gear its efforts towards a sustainable future. </span><a href="http://www.thelibrary.eco/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span>www.thelibrary.eco</span></a><span>. </span><span>#TheLibraryStudyHall</span></p>
      <p><strong>About the MIT Media Lab: </strong><span>The Media Lab opened the doors to its I.M. Pei-designed Wiesner Building in 1985, and in its first decade was at the vanguard of the technology that enabled the digital revolution and enhanced human expression: innovative research ranging from cognition and learning, to electronic music, to holography. In its second decade, the Lab literally took computing out of the box, embedding the bits of the digital realm with the atoms of our physical world. This led to expanded research in wearable computing, wireless “viral” communications, machines with common sense, new forms of artistic expression, and innovative approaches to how children learn. Now, in its fourth decade, the Media Lab continues to check traditional disciplines at the door. Product designers, nanotechnologists, data-visualization experts, industry researchers, and pioneers of computer interfaces work side by side to invent—and reinvent—how humans experience, and can be aided by, technology.</span></p>
      <p><strong>About the MIT Media Lab Director’s Fellow Program: </strong><span>The Media Lab's Director’s Fellows program is a growing global network that connects the innovation and creativity of the MIT Media Lab with a broad array of leaders to catalyze thought partnership and concrete collaborations. Its goal is to expand the diversity, reach, and impact of the Media Lab and the Director’s Fellows themselves in deploying cutting edge technology, ideas, and innovation to tackle key global challenges. It also helps to shape the perspectives and experience of stakeholders throughout the network, strengthening their capacity to serve and to lead.</span></p>

      <p><span></span><span><strong>About The Theatre at Ace Hotel:</strong> </span>The Theatre at Ace Hotel Downtown Los Angeles is Ace's loving re-animation of the historic United Artists Theater. Built in 1927 for the maverick film studio founded by Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks, The Theatre stands as a monument to a group of seminal American artists — modern iconoclasts striking out on their own. Ace’s restoration of this majestic space serves as a singular stage for art, film, dance and creative celebration in the heart of the Broadway Theater District’s vibrant modern renaissance.
