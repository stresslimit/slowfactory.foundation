      <!-- <p class="title-md">Program Overview</p> -->

      <p class="title-sm">Product Design / System Design</p>
      <p>WM (Waste Management) & Slow Factory Foundation are joining forces to support the next generation of fashion designers in applying circular and regenerative principles to their work.</p>

      <p>Through the program, up to 10 participants will engage in a 9-month challenge to create design solutions for fashion products, materials or systems that embrace regenerative practices. The program will culminate in a showcase at the 2022 WM Sustainability Forum.</p>

      <p class="title-md">How does it work?</p>
      <p>From the beginning of the project, participants will consider and incorporate their fashion innovation’s end-of-life, i.e. waste state, by creating a climate positive or circular garment or system innovation. This is the foundation of waste-led design, a term devised by Slow Factory co-founder Colin Vernon.</p>

      <p>This program will challenge participants to experiment with and provide tangible  solutions for disassembly and reuse of products through de-manufacturing, up-cycling materials and other processes.</p>
