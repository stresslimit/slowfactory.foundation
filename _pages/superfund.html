Phase 2: Support Domestic Migrant Workers
In partnership with two local organizations, Egna Legna and This is Lebanon, Phase 2 of our Super Fund for Beirut will be supporting domestic migrant workers. Under the Kafala system, domestic migrant workers, who are the main caretakers of many families and homes in Lebanon, are completely stripped of their human rights. Following the explosion, thousands were abandoned by their employees without permission to back to their home country. (edited)

Phase 2 Goals:
Pressure the Lebanese government to abolish the Kafala System
Help repatriate migrant workers to their home country
Provide humanitarian relief for migrant workers
“All migrant domestic workers are excluded from the Lebanese Labour Law and are governed instead by the Kafala system, which ties the legal residency of the worker to the contractual relationship with the employer.” – Amnesty International

About Egna Legna
Egna Legna is a secular and apolitical community-based organization working on migrant domestic workers’ issues and women’s issues in Lebanon and Ethiopia. Led by Ethiopian feminist women seeking to support their community, they fight against the injustices of Kafala, gender-based violence and the exploitation of adolescent labour.
About This Is Lebanon
This Is Lebanon is run by a coalition of former migrant workers and activists demanding the protection of migrant domestic workers, and an end to labour exploitation and abuse. They aim to inform domestic workers of their rights and support their access to justice while advocating and campaigning to effectively end the Kafala System.

        <p class="title-sm">Super Fund was originally slated to launch in fall 2020 with a mandate to fund social and environmental justice. Today we are accelerating the launch, given the August 4 explosion in Beirut where 2,750 metric tons of ammonium nitrate, a chemical used for fertilizers or explosives, erupted in the port of Beirut, killing civilians, destroying hospitals, and erasing most culturally vibrant neighborhoods in Beirut. Designers, fashion ateliers, libraries and cultural centers have been reduced to rubble.</p>

        <p class="">Slow Factory is launching a five year plan through its Super Fund to fundraise and strategically distribute funds in support of local, grassroots and independent NGOs on the ground in Beirut first, and eventually around the world working at the intersection of social and environmental justice. This global fundraiser ensures the viability of works at the intersection of Human Rights & Environmental Justice.</p>

        <p>The designers and creatives whose showrooms and studios are located in the epicentre of the damaged area are now struggling to survive. In a single moment, their livelihoods, life achievements and businesses disappeared. A first focus of Super Fund will be this important sector who is receiving no other aid, and is a reflection of Lebanon’s unique culture and a vital industry supporting livelihood and employment.
