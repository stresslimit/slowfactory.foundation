  <p class="title-lg">Dear Slow Factory community,</p>

</div>

<div class="container-sm text-lg">

  <p>I want to take the time to acknowledge the support and love we have received this past year and to give you all an idea of the impact we were able to have together. In just one year, we grew our digital community from 40K to 230K; this meant more people were aware of and learning about the concepts surrounding social and environmental justice, sustainability as a culture and international human rights justice. We have granted over $250,000 to humanitarian, scientific and environmental programs. Our continuously growing community is thanks to every single one of you who donated, shared, reposted, commented, liked and supported the work we put out there.</p>

  <p>In 2020 we have collectively experienced a series of crises and together we mobilized to fundraise and support our community here in the United States and abroad in Lebanon.</p>

  <p>With Open Education we have created a curriculum for 6,500 students and contracted the work of almost two dozen Black, Brown, Indigenous and Minority Ethnic scholars, thinkers, educators, thought leaders. Combined with Open Education and our Slow Talks interview series, we’ve created dozens of hours of educational materials to massive awareness and impact of the most pressing social and environmental issues.</p>

  <p>With One X One, the first science incubator in fashion, we have granted over $150,000 for human rights and environmental programs contributing to the advancement of research and development in climate positive solutions that are rooted in equity centered design. One X One projects were groundbreaking in their scientific and design achievements, all three projects were covered by Vogue, Forbes, Nylon Magazine, Harper’s Bazaar, CNN and the Guardian to name a few.</p>

  <p>With the Super Fund for Beirut, we have successfully raised over $100,000 for an immediate emergency relief fund.</p>

  <p>In 2021 we have set to achieve bigger and bolder goals where ambition and action are celebrated in order for us to speed up our achievements towards addressing climate change and social inequalities around the world. We turn to you as always to thank you and to ask that you remain engaged in this movement and that you continue to support the work that we do financially if you can, and by sharing the information and research our team generously puts out there. If you can contribute monthly it would allow our team to focus on the research and development related to new projects and legislations we are working on. Open Education 2021 will be announced at the end of January and we hope you all will join our 2021 curriculum.</p>

  <p>We promise to continue to share valuable information with you throughout this year and create a way for us to work together hand in hand in addressing this existential threat with unity and strength.</p>

  <p>Wishing you all a peaceful and powerful start of a new year. Remain alert, and inspired.</p>

  <p>Sincerely,</p>
