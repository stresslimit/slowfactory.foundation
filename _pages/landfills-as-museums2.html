    <p>Our mission is to educate and advocate for a waste-led design approach that considers the end of life of materials at the beginning of the design process. We aim to educate students and emerging designers and encourage them to implement circular design and other sustainability thinking methods into their products to reduce the burden placed on landfills.</p>
    <p>Reframing Landfills as Museums allows us to reconsider them as a valuable opportunity to educate about waste, and think about the resources and opportunities to divert materials before they end up at the landfill.</p>
