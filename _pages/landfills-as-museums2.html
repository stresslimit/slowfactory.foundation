        <p class="title-sm">Landfills are physical sites where waste is disposed of and contained. Unlike garbage “dumps,” landfills are run by waste management companies who employ different environmental stewardship practices.</p>

        <p class="title-sm">How Landfills Work</p>
        <p>Modern, engineered landfills use different types of monitoring systems and technology to contain waste so it doesn’t leak toxins into the environment. As material decomposes it releases methane gas, which can be collected and burned to generate electricity. Water is also purified and put back into the ecosystem.</p>

    <p class="title-sm">While landfills strive to efficiently manage waste and maximize the re-use of resources, they are still positioned at the end of the production system and they’re not a long term solution for human waste. Today most production systems are created using a linear method, which results in an abundance of waste.</p>

         <p class="title-md">Why is waste a problem?</p>

    <div class="row valign-top">
      <div class="half">
        <p>According to the United Nations we dump 2.12 billion tons of waste every year. In 2017, 52% of the waste generated by the US ended up in a landfill – that’s 139.6 million tons according to the EPA. In the Global South, waste often ends up in landfills lacking proper funding and legislation to implement effective waste management systems.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="half">
        <p> These landfills pollute the air, soil, and water creating a plethora of issues for vulnerable, at-risk communities. The greenhouse gases generated by the waste furthers the depletion of the ozone layer and increases respiratory diseases among other health issues.</p>

    <p class="title-md">What is a Linear System?</p>

    <div class="row valign-top">
      <div class="half">
        <p>Linear production systems rely on the extraction of raw materials, which uses up the earth’s resources, expels more carbon and contributes to climate change.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="half">
        <p>Starting from design to product creation, marketing and sales, many companies do not consider a product’s end of life, which often causes the item to be discarded and end up in a landfill.</p>

     <p class="title-md">Sustainable Circular Systems</p>

    <div class="row valign-top">
      <div class="half">
        <p class="">Through a sustainable circular system, we can reduce extraction and the buildup of waste. Reframing linear systems as circular ones relies on identifying all the steps at which elements can be recycled, reused, and remanufactured in a way that allows for a closed loop system that regenerates itself. Through this framework waste is no longer the last stage of an object’s life. Instead waste becomes a core part of the object’s creation process and helps extend the circularity of the production system. Waste becomes food rather than poison.</p>

    <div class="row valign-top">
      <div class="half">
        <p>Waste issues and linear systems impact human life and biodiversity. When a product’s end of life is considered at the beginning, it allows us to reduce its environmental impact later on. With a sustainable, circular system we can do less extraction and create less waste.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="half">
        <p>The practice challenges us to see a product’s end of life as a consideration equal to functionality, material, and print and pattern. By doing this waste becomes a part of the production system rather than an afterthought, which minimizes the amount of debris that winds up in a landfill.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The circulation of disposable plastic bags is an extremely wasteful system, so comparing a reusable vs. a disposable bag is a false equivalency.

                Although the environmental impact of one cotton bag is much greater than a single plastic bag when looking at the overall life cycle impact of the bags, the cotton tote bag is the more sustainable option. Not only do we as a society consume many more plastic bags than tote bags, at the end of their life cotton tote bags may be upcycled and repurposed into different products. Only 1% of plastic bags get recycled, while the rest end up deeply disturbing the ecosystems of our oceans and forests and never truly decompose.
